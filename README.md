Andy's Conquest Game
============


Description
-----------

This game was coded great, but planned poorly. I didn't really decide the rules, goal of game, etc ahead of time. If you can ever finish it without dying of boredom, you will find that I never coded an ending.
But, it's a fine display of my React skills!
